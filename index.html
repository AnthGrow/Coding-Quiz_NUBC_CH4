<!-- Pseudo Code

AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score 



Title
start button that when clicked reveals the first question, and starts the timer
The first question will have selectable button answers that when clicked will display whether the answer is correct or incorrect
if correct it will advance to the next question, if incorrect it will remain on the question until the correct answer is chosen
After the last question it will say all done, show you your score, and ask for your initials
There will be a view highschores area in the top of the page where these initials will go after taking the quiz
